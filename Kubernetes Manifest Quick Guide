      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html  # Path where the volume is mounted inside the container

  volumes:                    # List of volumes available for the Pod
  - name: config-volume       # Name of the volume
    configMap:                # Specify a ConfigMap as the source for the volume
      name: techops-config    # Reference the ConfigMap named "techops-config"

  restartPolicy: Always       # Pod restart policy (Always, OnFailure, or Never)

  nodeSelector:               # Specifies nodes eligible to run the Pod
    disktype: ssd             # Pod will run only on nodes labeled "disktype=ssd"

  tolerations:                # Allow scheduling on nodes with specific taints
  - key: "special-taint"      # Key of the taint to tolerate
    operator: "Equal"         # Operator to match the taint (Exact match: "Equal")
    value: "true"             # Value the key must match
    effect: "NoExecute"       # Effect: NoExecute (evict if running), NoSchedule (don’t schedule)

  securityContext:            # Pod-level security settings
    runAsUser: 1000           # Run the container processes as this user ID
    runAsGroup: 3000          # Run the container processes with this group ID
    fsGroup: 2000             # Ownership for filesystem volumes mounted by the Pod

  initContainers:             # Initialization containers that run before main containers
  - name: init-techops        # Name of the init container
    image: busybox            # Docker image for the init container
    command:                  # Commands executed in the init container
    - "sh"
    - "-c"
    - "echo Init; sleep 5"    # Example: Print "Init" and sleep for 5 seconds
```

### Explanation of Each Section

1. **`apiVersion`**: Defines the API version for this Kubernetes resource (v1 is for core resources like Pods).
2. **`kind`**: Specifies the resource type (`Pod` here).
3. **`metadata`**: Contains identifying details like the name and labels for the Pod.
4. **`spec`**: Describes the desired state of the Pod:
   - **`containers`**: Main containers to run within the Pod.
   - **`volumeMounts`**: Links a volume to a directory inside the container.
   - **`volumes`**: Defines the data sources like ConfigMaps used as volumes.
   - **`restartPolicy`**: Controls Pod restart behavior.
   - **`nodeSelector`**: Ensures the Pod runs on nodes matching specific criteria.
   - **`tolerations`**: Allows Pods to tolerate specific taints for scheduling.
   - **`securityContext`**: Defines security settings like user/group permissions.
   - **`initContainers`**: Run before regular containers to perform initialization task.


### In Kubernetes, **`spec` within `spec`** occurs when certain objects in a manifest have their own detailed specifications nested under the parent `spec`. This is common when a higher-level resource like a Pod contains components (like containers) that need further configuration.

Let’s break it down:

---

### Outer `spec` (Pod-Level)
The outer `spec` defines the overall desired state of the Pod, which includes details about how the Pod should behave. This typically includes:
- **`containers`**: List of containers running in the Pod.
- **`volumes`**: Volumes available for use by containers.
- **`restartPolicy`**: Determines the restart behavior of the Pod.
- **`nodeSelector`**: Specifies which nodes are eligible to run the Pod.
- **`tolerations`**: Rules to allow Pods to tolerate node taints.
- **`securityContext`**: Pod-level security settings.

---

### Inner `spec` (Container-Level)
Inside the **outer `spec`**, the **`containers`** field contains a list of container definitions. Each container can have its own `spec`-like configuration, even though it isn’t explicitly named `spec`. This includes:
- **`name`**: Name of the container.
- **`image`**: Docker image used by the container.
- **`ports`**: Ports the container exposes.
- **`env`**: Environment variables specific to this container.
- **`volumeMounts`**: Volumes mounted within this container.

This "container-level spec" essentially defines how individual containers should behave, nested inside the Pod's overall `spec`.

---

### Why Nested Structure?
This nested structure exists because Kubernetes resources like Pods often manage multiple entities:
1. The **Pod's `spec`** ensures the Pod behaves correctly at the infrastructure level.
2. The **container-level spec** ensures each container within the Pod functions as intended.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:                             # Pod-level spec
  containers:                     # List of containers in the Pod
  - name: nginx-container         # First container
    image: nginx:1.23             # Container-level spec starts here
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    env:
    - name: ENV
      value: production
  - name: sidecar-container       # Second container
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello"]
```

In this example:
- The **outer `spec`** defines the Pod.
- The nested container-level details (like `image`, `ports`, `env`) configure the behavior of each container.

This modular approach ensures clear separation between Pod-level and container-level configurations while allowing detailed customization.
